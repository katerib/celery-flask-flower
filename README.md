# Basic Flask App Template

## Description

This repository contains a sample Flask application intended to serve as a template for developers. By cloning this repo, you gain access to a pre-configured Flask environment, allowing for a quick development setup.

This Flask app relies on Python for the frontend and backend, HTML/CSS for page structure and styling, and Jinja2 for templating. 

## Deployment

Create a project folder by cloning the repository and add a .venv folder within:

    git clone https://github.com/katerib/basic-flask-app.git
    cd basic-flask-app
    py -e -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    .venv\Scripts\activate

Install Flask and all required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements

Run the Flask app with debugging turned on (for autoreload upon changes):

    flask --app src/app --debug run

You can now view your app at: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## App Requirements 

Below are some sample requirements that can be included in the app README. The template app does not meet all of these requirements in its current state.

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**: Support for user sign-up, login, and logout functionalities.
1. **Database Integration**: Configuration for connecting to a SQL or NoSQL database.
1. **RESTful API**: Implementation of a RESTful API to handle CRUD operations on resources.
1. **Form Handling**: Secure processing and validation of user input from forms.
1. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling to manage and respond to exceptions gracefully.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The application should be optimized for speed and efficiency, capable of handling multiple requests per second without significant latency.
1. **Security**: Implementations of standard security measures, including data encryption, XSS protection, and CSRF protection.
1. **Scalability**: The architecture should support scalability, allowing for easy expansion as the user base grows.
1. **Maintainability**: Code should be well-documented and structured to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.

### Additional Requirements and Future Features

- **Integration with third-party services**: Outline plans for incorporating external APIs and services (e.g., payment gateways, email services).
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the web application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes.
- **User Role Management**: Framework for managing different user roles and permissions within the application.
- **Localization and Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages and regional settings.

## Planning and Development Phase

- **Design**: Short description of design plans or link to Figma.
- **Project Timeline**: Step into each phase of development or link to project management board.
